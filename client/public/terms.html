    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last Updated: February 14, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Effective: February 14, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you," "your," or "User") and Umbra Global LLC ("Umbra Global," "PermitWise," "we," "our," or "us"), governing your access to and use of the PermitWise platform, including our web application, mobile applications, APIs, and all related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>By creating an account, accessing, or using PermitWise in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>To use PermitWise, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be at least 18 years of age</li>

      <li>Not be prohibited from using the Service under any applicable law</li>

    </ul>
    <p>If you are using PermitWise on behalf of a business entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>PermitWise is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that provides tools to help mobile vendors, food truck operators, and event organizers manage permits, track compliance, and organize their businesses. The Service includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Permit Tracking &amp; Management:</strong> Track permits across multiple jurisdictions, monitor expiration dates, and receive automated renewal reminders</li>
      <li><strong>Document Vault:</strong> Securely upload and store permits, insurance certificates, inspection reports, and other business documents</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance Checklists:</strong> Access and customize inspection and compliance checklists</li>
      <li><strong>Permit Requirement Data:</strong> Browse city-specific permit requirements for various vendor types</li>
      <li><strong>Event Management:</strong> Create, manage, and track events; handle vendor applications; and monitor vendor compliance (for Event Organizer accounts)</li>
      <li><strong>Event Attendance Tracking:</strong> Track events you plan to attend and monitor your permit readiness</li>

    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> PermitWise does NOT file, submit, or process permit applications on your behalf. We do NOT guarantee the approval, issuance, or renewal of any permit, license, or inspection. We do NOT act as a government agency, legal advisor, or regulatory body.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. No Legal, Regulatory, or Compliance Advice</h2>
    <p>PermitWise is an organizational tool, not a legal service.

      <li>Permit requirements, fees, and processes change frequently and vary by jurisdiction. Our database may not reflect the most current regulations at all times.</li>
      <li>You are <strong>solely responsible</strong> for verifying all permit requirements directly with the appropriate government agencies before relying on any information presented in PermitWise.</li>
      <li>We are not a law firm, accounting firm, or regulatory consulting service. Nothing in the Service constitutes legal, tax, financial, or compliance advice.</li>
      <li>We strongly recommend consulting qualified professionals for specific legal or regulatory questions.</li>
    </ul>
